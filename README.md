# Fair Carpool Sharing Project
#### by Jack Mao, Audrey Lee, Shirin Kuppusamy

There are three files in this repository:
generate_schedule.py : This file creates a random schedule
``` carpool.py ``` : This file includes our code for BFS and for Edmonds-Karp
``` test.py ``` : This file contains our test cases to verify correct functionality of our algorithm

To run our project, open a terminal and run ```bash python test.py``` If you would like
to try deterministic schedules not already in our test cases, then you
can add a new function in test.py.
